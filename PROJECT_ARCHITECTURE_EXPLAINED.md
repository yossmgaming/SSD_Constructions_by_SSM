# SSD Constructions: Current Web Architecture & Legacy Overview

## Executive Summary
**SSD Constructions** has transitioned to a modern, cloud-first architecture. The current, up-to-date version of the software is a robust React-based web application integrated with Supabase. 

> [!NOTE]
> The C# WPF desktop application (`MainFunctions`) is officially designated as the **Legacy Version**. It served as the primary inspiration for the current web architecture but is no longer in active use for day-to-day operations.

## 🚀 Current Architecture: SSD Web Dashboard (`ssd-react`)
The active production environment is a high-performance web suite designed for real-time construction management.

### 🌐 Frontend Technology Stack
*   **Framework**: React 19 (Vite)
*   **UI/UX**: Premium styling using **Tailwind CSS**, with interactive animations powered by **Framer Motion**.
*   **Visualizations**: Real-time project metrics via **Recharts** and high-fidelity 3D assets via **Three.js**.
*   **Localization**: Full multilingual support (English, Sinhala, etc.) through `i18next`.

### ☁️ Backend & Infrastructure (Supabase)
The web app utilizes **Supabase** as its backbone, providing:
*   **PostgreSQL Database**: Secure, relational data storage.
*   **Authentication**: Managed user login and registration flows.
*   **Security (RLS)**: Row Level Security ensures that data access is restricted based on user roles and invite-based governance.
*   **Governance Layer**: Custom schemas handle complex organization permissions and administrative control.

## 📊 Core Functional Modules (Active)

### 👷 Workforce & Personnel Intelligence
*   **Attendance Tracking**: Advanced daily logging with project-specific assignments.
*   **Payroll System**: Dynamic calculation of daily rates, overtime (OT), and weekly allowances.
*   **Personnel Command Center**: A forensic-style intelligence hub for detailed worker profiles and performance metrics.
*   **Advances & Settlements**: Real-time tracking of worker advances and payroll reconciliation.

### 🏗️ Project Lifecycle & Procurement
*   **Project Management**: End-to-end tracking of budgets, expenses, and progress percentages.
*   **Inventory Control**: Material stock management with intelligent "Low Stock" alerts and supplier linking.
*   **Supplier Relations**: Comprehensive database of vendors, categories, and financial obligations.

### 💰 Financial Operations
*   **BOQ Generator**: Automated generation of Professional Bills of Quantities for estimations.
*   **Agreement Generator**: Dynamic legal contract creation for workers and suppliers, eliminating hardcoded templates.
*   **Strategic Reporting**: Comprehensive financial dashboards, project-wise expense reports, and cash flow analysis.

## 📜 Legacy Context: C# WPF App (`MainFunctions`)
The original desktop application was built using .NET and WPF. While it contains the foundational logic for BOQs and payroll, all modern features and active data migrations have been ported to the Web Dashboard. 

**Key Legacy Features (Migrated to Web):**
*   Local SQLite management.
*   Desktop-based document rendering.
*   Initial service patterns for payroll and attendance.
